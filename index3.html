  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <p>In recent years, communication networks have evolved into critical infrastructure, enabling ubiquitous connectivity for massive terminals and command dissemination. They not only support consumer applications such as AR/VR, online gaming, and streaming but also facilitate industrial services like smart manufacturing, autonomous driving, and telemedicine. However, the current network development paradigm faces significant challenges in flexibility, scalability, differentiated service provisioning, mobility support, global operation and maintenance (O&M), and security assurance. These limitations hinder the ability to meet the diverse and specialized demands of emerging applications, including human-machine-IoT intelligent networking, all-time and space-time casual access, service performance guarantees, security and quantifiable design and verification, network big data, and distributed network computing.</p>
  <p>To fully realize next-generation networking, these challenges must be addressed through innovative architectural and algorithmic advancements.</p>
  <p>The Polymorphic Network (PN) is an emerging paradigm in network architecture. Its ultimate objective is to achieve unified control and dynamic scheduling of both forwarding behavior and heterogeneous resources across the entire network. Building upon existing programmable networking techniques, PN extends and enhances their capabilities. Unlike the traditional IP-based Internet, PN evolves into a next-generation network system that supports the coexistence and evolution of diverse networking paradigms—such as IP, NDN, and MobilityFirst—enabling tailored solutions for specific application requirements. Furthermore, PN expands programmability beyond the conventional "resolution + matching + action" model to incorporate additional dimensions, including computation, storage, and forwarding, thereby enabling a fully customizable and definable network environment.</p>
  <p>One of the primary functions of PN is to enhance quality of service. Traditional unimodal network architectures often struggle to optimize performance across all service types simultaneously. For example, while IP networks can minimize latency for video calls, they may increase latency for video conferences—whereas NDN exhibits the opposite trade-off. In contrast, a PN can dynamically instantiate an IP-based modality for video calls and an NDN-based modality for video conferences, enabling optimal performance for both services.</p>
  <p>The PN workshop offers two key benefits to attendees. First, it provides an accessible introduction to this emerging and dynamic research field, broadening its reach to a wider audience. Second, it serves as a platform for the research community to actively discuss pressing challenges, explore new opportunities, and shape future directions in PN research.</p>
